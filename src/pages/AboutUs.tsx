                A Capture The Flag (CTF) event is a cybersecurity competition
                where participants tackle various security-related challenges to
                capture virtual flags. These challenges often span areas like
                cryptography, reverse engineering, web security, and network
                exploitation.

                  The event can be structured in different formats, such as
                  Jeopardy style, where teams solve independent challenges for
                  points, or Attack-Defense, where teams defend their systems
                  while attempting to exploit others.

                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  Participants gain points by solving these challenges and
                  uncovering hidden flags, with the highest-scoring team
                  winning. CTF events not only test technical skills and
                  problem-solving abilities but also foster collaboration and
                  learning within the cybersecurity community.
